=====> This is the Substitution Cipher menu

What is substitution cipher?
- Substitution cipher is replacing letter of a message by other distinct letters by a defined by other group of symbols
- To perform this encryption/decryption, you need a message and a key (a string to replace the alphabet string - needs at least 26 characters)
- If your key has less than 26 characters, the encryption/decryption will still run, but the results may not be correct
- If the key has more than 26 characters, it will be considered as invalid key

Do you want to:
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
0. Back

Please enter your message/ciphertext, the key and your option.
